    <h3>Are we actually using energy at the best of our capability?</h3>
    <h4>Here in Ireland we face two major problems:</h4>
    <ol type="1">
        <li>We do not use energy thoughtfully, we do not switch between multiple electricity sources at peak costs;</li>
        <li>We do not take in consideration the differences between rural and urban areas;</li>
        <li>We do not take advantage of Irelandâ€™s geography.</li>
    </ol>
    <p>Our aim is to incentivise citizens to be more mindful of their energy use.</p>

    <br>
    <h2>Climate Action Plan 2021</h2>
    <p>In 2021 The Irish Government enstblished the Climate Action Plan 2021: according to the plan, by 2030, Energy's
        sources wil be all renewable</p>

    <br>
    <h2>Wind Energy</h2>
    <p>Wind is one of Ireland's main sources of energy. It is cheaper then fossil fuel and Ireland has abundance of
        wind. It would also cut down both the exports from abroad for fossil fuel and the pollution level.
        However we should vary our energy sources. Ireland cannot rely on wind energy alone and luckily we have access
        to other resources as well: from thermal energy to hydro energy, Ireland is rich of resources.
        Ireland is covered with Wind generators, especially along the coast.</p>

    <br>
    <h2>Thermal Energy</h2>
    <p>Thermal energy is one of the main resources here in Ireland. It comes from the Sun, the gorund or anything that
        is able to produce heat.
        The Counties of Clare, Cork, Dublin, Kildare and Wicklow have quite an abundance of thermal energy.
    </p>

    <br>
    <h2>Hydro Energy</h2>
    <p>Hydro energy is another important part of our electricity generation. Some of Ireland's lake contribute to the
        Irish energy supply.
        Hydro generators' locations focus in the Counties of Cork, Donegal, Kerry, Kildare and Sligoo.
    </p>

    <br>
    <p>In moments of low demand, such as during Autumn and Spring, the elecricity can be stored in a machine, called
        pumped storage generator.
        The pumped storage generator is able to preserve the electrical energy in excess produced during periods of low
        demand. At the peaks of demand during the year, the electricity energy stored will be used.
        Ireland, as of now, has one pumped storage generator and its location is in the County of Wicklow.</p>

    <p>
        Even though generators are more prelevant on the area of the coasts, Ireland is provided with strong cable to
        connect the genrators to less equipped areas.
        They have a good coverage of the Northen regions, the internal part of the coast and the central part of
        Ireland.
