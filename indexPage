<h3>Are we actually using energy at the best of our capability?</h3>
<h4>Here in Ireland we face two major problems:</h4>
<ol type="1">
    <li>We do not use energy thoughtfully, we do not switch between multiple electricity sources at peak costs;</li>
    <li>We do not take in consideration the differences between rural and urban areas;</li>
    <li>We do not take advantage of Irelandâ€™s geography.</li>
</ol>
<p>Our aim is to incentivise citizens to be more mindful of their energy use.</p>
