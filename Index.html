    <h1>EirGrid - Renewable Energy</h1>

<h3>Are we actually using energy at the best of our capability?</h3>
<h4>Here in Ireland we face two major problems:</h4>
<ol type="1">
    <li>We do not use energy thoughtfully, we do not switch between multiple electricity sources at peak costs;</li>
    <li>We do not take in consideration the differences between rural and urban areas;</li>
    <li>We do not take advantage of Irelandâ€™s geography.</li>
</ol>
<p>Our aim is to incentivise citizens to be more mindful of their energy use.</p>

<h2>Climate Action Plan 2021</h2>
<p>In 2021 The Irish Government enstblished the Climate Action Plan 2021: according to the plan, by 2030, Energy's sources wil be all renewable PAG 44 All-Island-Ten-Year-Transmission-Forecast-Statement-TYTFS-2021.pdf </p>

<h2>Wind Energy</h2>
<p>Wind is one of Ireland's main sources of energy. It is cheaper then fossil fuel and Ireland has abundance of wind. It would also cut down both the exports from abroad for fossil fuel and the pollution level.
However we should vary our energy sources. Ireland cannot rely on wind energy alone and luckily we have access to other resources as well:  from thermal energy to hydr energy, Ireland is rich of resources.</p>

<h2>Thermal Energy</h2>
<p>Thermal energy is one of the main resources here in Ireland</p>
